Intelligent Handwritten Board
Overview
This project focuses on text segmentation, x-y point detection, and character image classification using Python. The goal is to accurately segment text, find x-y coordinates, determine character height and width, and classify each segment. After classification, the recognized text is saved in a PDF format.

Key Features
Text Segmentation:

Implemented a robust text segmentation algorithm to identify individual segments within an image.
X-Y Point Detection:

Successfully located x-y points for precise positioning of text segments.
Character Image Analysis:

Extracted height and width information for each character image to capture its dimensions accurately.
Classification using Machine Learning:

Utilized machine learning techniques to classify segmented characters, enhancing accuracy and reliability.
PDF Generation:

Integrated a PDF generation module to compile the recognized text segments into a coherent document.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries and Frameworks:
OpenCV for image processing
Scikit-learn for machine learning
PDFKit for PDF generation
